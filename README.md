# Graduation
Code written in the context of my graduation project on Human-Robot Interaction

## Requirements
- Python 2.7.x
- ZMQ
- pyserial
- pyOSC

## Installation of requirements
If you have pip installed, simply use

```
sudo pip install zmq
sudo pip install pyserial
sudo pip install numpy
sudo pip install scipy
sudo pip install https://pypi.python.org/packages/7c/e4/6abb118cf110813a7922119ed0d53e5fe51c570296785ec2a39f37606d85/pyOSC-0.3.5b-5294.tar.gz#md5=ea027aae543aad2ecf7ae51c2a6b6626
```
pip sometimes has an issue finding pyOSC, hence the long url.

## Music software
This project is programmed to work with Ableton Live 9, and requires Ableton Live 9.5 and liveOSC to be able to adjust the music tempo.

BugList

#1 Action move:
    interpolation between endpoints might be bugged, cannot tell with weak servos
    -> looks to be the jitter bug (# 4)
    

#2 beatDetect.py:
    BPM cannot drop to 0 - not sure if this will be an issue during actual use
    
#3 beatDetect2.py:
    Solved above issue but at the cost of accuracy (a lot of it)
    
#4 Servo 1 (BV) (Hig Power) moves rather jittery. Unknown cause.

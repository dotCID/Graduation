Priorities for concert
--------------------------

0. More robust sensor casings

1. User contact
    - user angles are output in ZMQ
    - needs interpretation and remembering
        - Interpretation: check

    - user contact margin needs tuning
    
2. Motions
    - mostly done
    - percentages need tuning
    
3. Beat motions

4. Beat increase/decrease
